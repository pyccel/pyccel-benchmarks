# Benchmarks

Several tests are available for the user to benchmark Pyccel against other common accelerators, notably [pythran](https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/).
The same code is used for all tests, only the decorators change.

The dependencies can be installed using the command `python3 -m pip install .`

The code can be executed by running the script `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py`.

In order to test pyccel and/or pythran, configuration files must be provided. An example configuration for pythran is found in [`benchmarks/config.pythranrc`](./benchmarks/config.pythranrc). This configuration is the default pythran configuration with the following additional flags:
- `-O3`
- `-march=native`
- `-mtune=native`
- `-mavx`
- `-ffast-math`

Pyccel configurations valid for your machine can be generated using the following command (which may be adapted for another compiler family, see the [pyccel documentation](https://pyccel.github.io/pyccel/docs/compiler.html)):
```
pyccel --compiler-family intel --export-compiler-config pyccel_intel.json
```
This configuration can then be modified to include additional flags or use different compilers. The tests shown below add the following additional flags (which match the flags added to pythran):
- `-O3`
- `-march=native`
- `-mtune=native`
- `-mavx`
- `-ffast-math`

Additional options can be used with this script to add further comparisons, change the output format, or change what is generated.

Run `python3 benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py --help` for more details.

The results below are presented for the current state of the development branch of pyccel, as well as the most recent version of pyccel available on pypi.

A requirements.txt file providing the necessary packages to reproduce the tests run can be found in the `version_specific_results` folder.
The environment can be reproduced using the following commands:
```
python3 -m venv my_virtual_environment
source my_virtual_environment/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
