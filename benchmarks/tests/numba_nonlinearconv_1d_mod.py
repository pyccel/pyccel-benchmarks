    """
    Compute an approximation of the solution u(t, x) to the 1D
    Burgers' equation

        du/dt + u du/dx = 0

    on the domain [0, 2], with initial conditions consisting of
    a Gaussian perturbation over a uniform background:

        u(t=0, x) = 1 + 0.5 exp( -((x-0.5)^2 / 0.15^2) ).

    The numerical solution is computed on a uniform grid using
    one-sided upwind finite-differences combined with explicit
    Euler time stepping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nx : int
        Number of grid points in the domain.

    dt : float
        Time step size.

    nt : int
        Number of time steps to be taken.

    Returns
    -------
    x : numpy.ndarray of nx floats
        Spatial grid where solution is computed.

    u : numpy.ndarray of nx floats
        Numerical solution u at final time.
