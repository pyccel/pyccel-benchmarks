# Benchmarks

Several tests are available for the user to benchmark Pyccel against other common accelerators, notably [pythran](https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/).
The same code is used for all tests, only the decorators change.

The dependencies can be installed using the command `python3 -m pip install .

The code can be executed by running the script `run_benchmarks.py`.
Additional options can be used with this script to add additional comparisons, change the output format, or change what is generated.

Run `python3 run_benchmarks.py --help` for more details.

The results below are presented for the current state of the development branch of pyccel, as well as the most recent version of pyccel available on pypi.
