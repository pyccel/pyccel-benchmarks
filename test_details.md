## Tests used

The tests used can be found in the [benchmarks/tests](./benchmarks/tests) directory.

### Ackermann

A basic implementation of the Ackermann function which is one of the simplest and oldest examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive.

### Bellman Ford

An algorithm for solving the shortest path problem. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Djikstra

An algorithm for solving the shortest path problem. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Euler

Solves an ordinary differential equation using Euler's method. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Midpoint Explicit

Solves an ordinary differential equation using the explicit midpoint method. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Midpoint Fixed

Solves an ordinary differential equation using the implicit midpoint method with a fixed number of iterations. The code is adapted from examples written by [J. Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/py_src.html)

### Splines

Evaluates a non-uniform spline saved as a class instance at a large number of test points. The code uses Algorithm A2.2 from the NURBS book (Piegl, Les, and Wayne Tiller. The NURBS book. Springer Science & Business Media, 2012.).
